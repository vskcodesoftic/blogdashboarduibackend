Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions

As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.
